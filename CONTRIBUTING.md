# How to contribute

Thanks for checking our our project! We'd love to have your help building it, if you're here to report a bug let us know via an [issue](https://github.com/ssatellite-im/Uplink/issues).

A summary of how to contribute is below. If you are a _developer_, also check out [this guide](docs/new-dev.md).

## Feature Requests

A feature request is _something you want to have included in WarpGUI_. We track feature requests on GitHub via [issues](https://github.com/satellite-im/Uplink/issues).

To reduce the number of duplicate requests, please search through the issues to see if something has already been suggested. If a feature you want has been suggested, then comment on that issue to let us know it's popular. You can use emoji-reactions to show us you really want to see a given feature. ❤️ We listen to our community.

## Bug Reports

Bugs should also be reported on GitHub via [issues](https://github.com/satellite-im/Uplink/issues). This allows us to track them and see how prevalent they are.

If you encounter a bug when using Uplink, check the issues to see if anyone else has encountered it. If it already exists, you can use emoji reactions to indicate it should be fixed ASAP!

## Pull Requests

If you want to write some code, develop the documentation, or otherwise work on a certain feature or bug, let us know by replying to or creating an [issue](https://github.com/satellite-im/Uplink/issues).
